# partDB

Originally I was using a MS Access database to keep track of various PC parts currently in our main database.  The main parts database does not allow me to narrow parts down to their specs.  A CPU is a CPU is a CPU you might say.  This made finding parts that could be subbed for one another tedious.  This app allows me to input part numbers and their specifications making that task much more efficient (and without the performance issues I had with MS Access).

The limitation of shelve became apparent as the application was developed enough to actually become useful.  Most of the original backend code has been scrapped and SQLite3 is being implemented.
